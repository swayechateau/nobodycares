## Why NobodyCares was created

Welcome to **NobodyCares**, created as a space to teach what I know to my future self. If it happens to help others along the way, that's even better! My aim is to have both an article and a video on YouTube, to cover various learning methods: reading, watching, and listening.

### The Inspiration

The name **NobodyCares** comes from a realization I had after years of flipping between different technology stacks. When I first started in the tech industry, my main focus was just to get inâ€”regardless of the technology I used. But as I gained more knowledge, I found myself constantly debating which language or framework was better, often switching stacks and losing focus on what really mattered: progress.

### Learning Through Experience

Through the pain of flip-flopping between technologies, I learned a valuable lesson: nobody really cares about the tools you use. What matters is the progress you make and the lessons you learn, even from failure. Even though I was told this by other developers and told myself this, documenting my journey, sharing my insights, and hopefully helping others will help us to avoid the same pitfalls now or in the future.

### Simplicity and Focus

I've come to appreciate the importance of keeping things simple. The goal of **NobodyCares** is to create content that emphasizes simplicity, progress, and practical learning. Whether you're just starting out or you've been in the industry for a while, my hope is that you'll find something useful here.

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find the content on **NobodyCares** both insightful and helpful.
