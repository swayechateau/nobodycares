## Solemnity Services Documentation

Solemnity is a suite of microservices designed to streamline common functionalities in my applications. After identifying a recurring need for certain components, I created dedicated microservices for each key element.

These services aim to enhance efficiency and maintainability across my applications by modularizing common functionalities. The goal is to create a robust ecosystem of microservices that can be easily integrated and reused in different projects.

### Single Sign-On (SSO)

Simplify authentication with a centralized SSO service.

- **Service URL:** [sso.solemnity.icu](https://sso.solemnity.icu)
- **GitHub Repository:** [solemnity-sso](https://github.com/swayechateau/solemnity-sso)

### Website Meta Data Grabber
Extract and utilize metadata from web links.

- **Service URL:** [meta.solemnity.icu](https://meta.solemnity.icu)
- **GitHub Repository:** [solemnity-meta](https://github.com/swayechateau/solemnity-meta)

### File Storage

Store files locally or on cloud providers like G Cloud, AWS S3, or Azure Blob Storage.

- **Service URL:** [file.solemnity.icu](https://file.solemnity.icu)
- **GitHub Repository:** [solemnity-fileserver](https://github.com/swayechateau/solemnity-fileserver)

### Scripts

Access various scripts needed by multiple projects and servers.

- **Service URL:** [scripts.solemnity.icu](https://scripts.solemnity.icu)
- **GitHub Repository:** [solemnity-scripts](https://github.com/swayechateau/solemnity-scripts)

### Future Services

More services will be added in the future to expand Solemnityâ€™s capabilities. Currently, some services like File Storage and SSO are still in development. All these applications are built with Go and Docker, except for Scripts, which is a mix of various languages and Bash files.
